### Architecture

This is an implementation of a webcrawler which works on 4 given websites below. All the recipe crawlers logic are seperated into different files inside /recipes directory so that it is easy to make edits if something breaks, all these files are imported in the recipes/index.js, this file also contains a function which holds logic and return the required recipe object to our route. Later on if we have many routes to handle, /routes directory can be made with different routes, but for this, as we only had one endpoint to handle I decided it do it in index.js

**Note on the deliverable:**

Ingredients was request to be an array of objects with diffrent fields like such =>

```shell
    "ingredients": [{"name": "Corn","quantity": "2}]
```

I implemented it as array of stings with all fields togther in a string like such =>

```shell
    "ingredients": ["3 ounces pollock", "1 cup rice"]
```

This could be done an array of objects with more code instead of string if absolutely necessary.

**Works only with following URL's**

```shell
    https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017518-panzanella-with-mozzarella-and-herbs
    https://www.eatthelove.com/cookies-and-cream-cookies/
    https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/bugeopo-gochujang-muchim
    https://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/croque-madam/
```
